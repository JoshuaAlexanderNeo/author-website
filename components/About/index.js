                Leif Maplesson was born in a city named after a bridge. When he was a teenager, he wrote a short story
                about jumping from said bridge. This garnered him no literary fame but did earn him a one-on-one
                exclusive interview with the school counsellor. He's been in love with writing ever since. He has been
                boxing with the Japanese language for the better part of a decade. Sure, his tango with <i>nihongo</i>{' '}
                has left him pummelled flat like <i>mochi</i>, but he hasn't heard no bell. (His ears swelled shut a
                long time ago. Don't tell him the fight was over before it began. He still thinks he has a chance.) He
